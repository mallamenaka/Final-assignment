Write a program in Python which will find all such numbers which are divisible  by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200.nl=[]for x in range(2000, 3200):    if (x%7==0) and (x%5==0):        nl.append(str(x))print (','.join(nl))6. What is the output of the following code examples??    x=123    	   for i in x:   		print(i)? i = 0while i < 5:    print(i)    i += 1    if i == 3:        breakelse:    print(“error”)? count = 0while True:    print(count)    count += 1    if count >= 5:        Break7. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.       Expected output: 0 1 2 4 5Note: Use ‘continue’ statementfor x in range(6):    if (x == 3 or x==6):        continue    print(x)print("\n")    8.  Write a program that accepts a string as an input from the user and calculate the number of digits and letters.     Expected output: consul12     Letters 6     Digits 2user = input(“Enter string with digits in it”)a,b = 0,0for i in range(len(user)):    if(user[i].isalpha()):        a = a + 1    else:        b = b + 1print(“letters :“, a, “\ndigits :“, b)9. Read the two parts of the question below: ?  Write a program such that it asks users to “guess the lucky number”. If the correct number is guessed the program stops, otherwise it continues forever. ? number = input("Guess the lucky number ")? while number != 5:?     print "That is not the lucky number"?     number = input("Guess the lucky number ")? Modify the program so that it asks users whether they want to guess again each time. Use two variables, ‘number’ for the number and ‘answer’ for the answer to the question whether they want to continue guessing. The program stops if the user guesses the correct number or answers “no”. ( The program continues as long as a user has not answered “no” and has not guessed the correct number)? number = -1? again = "yes"? while number != 5 and again != "no":?     number = input("Guess the lucky number: ")?     if number != 5:?         print "That is not the lucky number"?     again = raw_input("Would you like to guess again? ")10. Write a program that asks five times to guess the lucky number. Use a while loop and a counter, such as           		counter=1		While counter <= 5:			print(“Type in the”, counter, “number”			counter=counter+1counter = 1while counter <= 5:    number = input("Guess the " + str(counter) + ". number ")        if number != 5:          print "Try again."        else:          print "Good guess!"        counter = counter +1      else:        print "Game over"    The program asks for five guesses (no matter whether the correct number was guessed or not). If the correct number is guessed, the program outputs “Good guess!”, otherwise it outputs “Try again!”. After the fifth guess it stops and prints “Game over!”.11. In the previous question, insert “break” after the “Good guess!” print statement. “break” will terminate the while loop so that users do not have to continue guessing after they found the number. If the user does not guess the number at all, print “Sorry but that was not very successful”.counter = 1      while counter <= 5:        number = input("Guess the " + str(counter) + ". number ")        if number != 5:          print "Try again."        else:          print "Good guess!"          break        counter = counter +1      else:        print "Sorry but that was not very successful"TASK THREE: DATA STRUCTURES1.
