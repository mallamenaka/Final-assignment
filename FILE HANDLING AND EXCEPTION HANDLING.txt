FILE HANDLING AND EXCEPTION HANDLING 1. Write a program in Python to allow the error of syntax to be handled using exception handling. HINT: Use SyntaxErrortry:    if 4 > 2        print(True)except SyntaxError:    print("Write better code silly person.")2. Write a program in Python to allow the user to open a file by using the argv module. If the entered name is incorrect throw an exception and ask them to enter the name again. Make sure to use read only mode. import sysfile_name = sys.argv[1]try:    fh = open(file_name, 'r')    text = fh.readlines()    fh.close()    print(text)except IOError:    print('Wrong file, Please enter the name again', file_name)3. Write a program to handle an error if the user entered a number more than four digits it should return ÒThe length is too short/long !!! Please provide only four digitsÓ while True:    x = int(input("Please enter a number: ")) # user inputs number    if x > 9999: # highest 4 digit number        raise Exception('The length is too long!!!')    else:        print(x)4. Create a login page backend to ask users to enter the username and password. Make sure to ask for a Re-Type Password and if the password is incorrect give chance to enter it again but it should not be more than 3 times. user = input("Enter the username: ")password = input("Enter the password: ")attempts = 1while attempts:    if attempts == 3:        raise Exception("Sorry! Too many attempts!! Account LOCKED!!!")    password = input('Please Re-Type Password: ')    attempts += 15.

Read doc.txt file using Python File handling concept and return only the even length string from the file. Consider the content of doc.txt as given below: Hello I am a file Where you need to return the data string Which is of even length Make sure you return the content in The same link as it is present. import sysfile_name = sys.argv[1]fh = open(file_name, 'r')text = fh.readlines()fh.close()for line in text:    if len(line) % 2 == 0:        print(line)    else:        continue
